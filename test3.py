@Shishya With all due respect the most voted answer doesn't solve this question in a direct manner. The question asks for git-rebase situation while the answer gives a flag for git-merge – Shubham Chaudhary Dec 28 '16 at 8:53

@AsifMohammed that's not what an accepted answer is for. People will automatically find the answer with the most votes because of the default sorting by votes. – Glorfindel Apr 8 '17 at 7:46

A mess has been made here by the fact that the title doesn't specify that this is in the context of a rebase, so your question is drawing in Googlers who are getting this error in different contexts and upvoting an answer that doesn't actually apply to the question you've asked. It can't be easily cleaned up now, so the incoherent Q&A pair will remain on the site and high in the Google search results forever. The moral of the story is that question titles matter! – Mark Amery Jun 30 '17 at 10:35
